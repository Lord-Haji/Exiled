## Exiled Server
<a href="http://exiled.psim.us" target="_blank">_A server filled with memes, and well a lot of chat commands and metagames._</a>
### Node Version:
This server requires the Node Js Version 6.6.0 or higher<br>
### To start:
#### `Windows`

* On Windows OS you can install a preferred Version of NodeJS easily from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Afte
installing your preffered version of NodeJS (>6.2), you can easily start up NodeJS Command Prompt then run
``node app`` or ``node app.js`` you even might specify the port in which to run the server on eg:- ``node app.js 8080`` if you do not mention the port, the mentioned port from **Config.port** will be used to run the server

#### `OS X`

* On OS X you can install NodeJS with Homebrew (the easiest way) just like ``brew install node``.
* If you do not have Homebew installed, firstly fire up the terminal and execute the following command:
``ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"``
* To verify if your node & npm installation with Homebrew wasn't corrupted use ``node -v`` & ``npm -v``.
* Make sure you always use the latest version of Homebrew if you do not have the latest version simply type ``brew update``
* To update Node use ``brew upgrade node`` on your terminal


#### `Linux`

* On Linux you need to have NodeJS installed (>6) if you do not have it installed simply open the terminal then run
``$ nvm install 6.2`` (6 or your prefered version)
* If you do not have ``nvm`` then run ``curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash`` then `` source ~/.profile`` to add ``nvm`` to the environment variables
* You can easily intall more than one version of NodeJS on your PC/VM with ``nvm install 6`` and use that using ``nvm use 6``
* Now your terminal is set to use nodejs 6 or your prefered version, now you can start up the server by running
``node app`` or ``node app.js`` you even might specify the port in which to run the server on eg:- ``node app.js 8080`` if you do not mention the port, the mentioned port from **Config.port** will be used to run the server
